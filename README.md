# WebGL-Living-Room
A webpage demonstrating a 3D render of a living room written in WebGL 

## Instructions

### Hosting texture files
-  The `texture` folder may need to be hosted from a local server, since your browser's CORS policy may prevent your browser from accessing the texture files
- I did this with npm's http-server package, which can easily be installed with `npm i http-server`, but feel free to use whatever method works for you

### Viewing the scene
- `cd` into the repository and open `living-room.html` with a Web-GL compatible browser
